I developed a fully responsive e-commerce website using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site features a modern, user-friendly interface, dynamic product listings, and interactive elements such as a shopping cart, product filtering, and search functionality. I implemented a structured layout with HTML, styled it for responsiveness and visual appeal using CSS (including Flexbox and Grid), and added interactivity through JavaScript for cart operations, modal popups, and real-time updates
